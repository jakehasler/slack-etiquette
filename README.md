# Podium Slack Etiquette Guide
Hi! Welcome to Podium's Slack etiquette guide. Slack is Podium's main method of communication, and provides a very seamless and fast-turnaround alternative to email. Here's a few tips to make sure you don't make people less-than-pleased toward you when using Slack, and to keep productivity high.

## When Should I @channel?
Almost never. **Especially in the community channels (#general, #utahoffice).** Here are things to ask yourself before you send out a message using @channel:
* Is the building on fire? OR..
* Is this message important to *everyone* in this channel?
* Does this message directly impact *everyone* in this channel?
* Will this message wake anyone up? (Please consider time zones, time of day, etc.)
* Is this message somewhat time-sensitive to *everyone* in this channel?

### @channel vs @here
If you need to @channel for any of the reasons above but don't want to send the message out to everyone _regardless_ of whether or not they're in Slack, use @channel's lessy noisy brother, @here. This will still blast the message out, but only to people that are on slack at that given time. Still try to use this rarely, as it will still send a lot of potentially unnecessary notifications.

## How do I _politely_ ask an entire channel a question?
Simply ask the question! But don't @channel or @here it unless you really think it applies to everyone, is time-sensitive, or very important (i.e. meeting room change, lunch announcements, etc...).
 
## How do I Manage my Notifications? (@channel and DM Preferences)
1. Open Slack
2. Find the channel you want to manage notifications for
3. Click the #<ChannelName> next to the search bar
4. Click "Channel notification preferences"
5. Manage 

## Targeted Notifications
If a message applies to a specific person in a channel, instead of just typing their name, you can @ mention them, and they will get a notification. This is better than them potentially not seeing the message, and _much_ better than @channel or @here-ing the entire channel, especially if it's a large channel.

## Do I have to use Slack?
Yes. Almost every day. Slack is Podium's main method of communication. You will miss out on questions, announcements, funny images, and more. And if you use email you will be ridiculed.
